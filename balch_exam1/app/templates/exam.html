<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Tucker Balch, I am from Suwanee Georgia, and I went to Peachtree Ridge High School. In high school I definitely was not an A+ student but I was on the cross country and track team all four years. I got out of high school with a 3.2 GPA and was on the varsity team for both sports for three years. When I graduated high school I joined the cross country team for Georgia College and strove to receive higher grades than I did previously.</p>
<p>Throughout college, in the classroom for the most part, I succeeded. I am currently majoring in Management Information Systems and so far I have only received one C in all my classes, and currently I have a 3.74. Cross country was a different story. I did run personal bests on the track, by running a 16:30 5k, however I struggled with injuries frequently. Cross country also became a much bigger commitment with a coaching change, where the new coach was much more serious and ambitious than the previous one. I decided I did not belong on a college team and decided to focus on school and my career after three years running in college. </p>
<p>Right at this moment I am pursuing a career with several different opportunities. One is to go into the MIS field, become a data analyst or any sort of developer. Another is to join the military, become an officer in the Coast Guard. My final career choice which would be a dream job of mine is to be an MIS professor or lecturer, where my top choice to teach at would be at Georgia College itself. All of these are very ambitious goals of mine but I am a hard workers and will push to obtain any three of these! </p>
